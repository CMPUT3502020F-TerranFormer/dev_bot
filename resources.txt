Things we are concerned with in resources (does, but we don't care about)
Command Centers produce scvs, Load SCV, Lift Off, (builds into planetary fortress or orbital command)
Planetary Fortress produces scvs, Load SCV, 
Orbital Command produces scvs, (Scanner Sweep), Calldown MULE, Calldown Supply, Lift Off

So scv's:
-> All scv's should be built at first 3 command centers / 
-> prioritize building at immediate command center -> near planetary fortress -> near orbital command
	(if buildling because one died, if in a group, same priority, if alone, immediate command center)
-> Do not produce across groups (travel danger)
-> Must request escort when moving from planetary fortress/orbital command to new map area (ie CactusValley;
	there are a few "groups" where centers should be built) (say, distance <= ??)

-> so, have a list of all units
-> Have a list of 3 current bases (actively mining resources)
-> the three current bases will have all the logic about which scv's go where, when to build / move location, etc)
